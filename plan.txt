1. Project Definition & Scope
Project Goal: To develop a web application using Next.js that allows a user to input their personal details (Name, Register Number, etc.), which are then used to populate a predefined cover page. This personalized cover page is then prepended to a static, multi-page technical document, and the final merged PDF is made available for the user to download.
Core Features (User Stories):
As a user, I want to see a simple web form where I can enter my name, register number, and group members' names.
As a user, I want to click a "Generate PDF" button to start the process.
As a user, I want the application to automatically create a final PDF with my details on the first page, followed by the complete technical report.
As a user, I want my browser to automatically download the final, combined PDF file.
Key Deliverables:
A functional Next.js web application.
A user interface with an input form.
A backend API endpoint capable of PDF manipulation.
The final downloadable, merged PDF report.
2. Technology Stack & Architecture
Frontend Framework: Next.js (React) - For building the user interface and handling server-side logic seamlessly.
Styling: Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules - For creating a clean, responsive design for the input form.
Backend Logic: Next.js API Routes (Node.js) - To handle the form submission and PDF processing on the server.
PDF Manipulation Library: pdf-lib - A powerful and popular Node.js library for creating, modifying, and merging PDF documents. It can load existing PDFs, add text, and combine documents.
Deployment: Vercel - The ideal platform for deploying Next.js applications, offering a seamless and free tier.
Application Flow Architecture:
Client (Browser): The user visits the web page and sees the React-based form.
User Input: The user fills in their details and clicks "Generate."
API Request: The frontend makes a POST request to a Next.js API route (e.g., /api/generate-pdf), sending the form data in the request body.
Server (API Route):
The API route receives the user's data.
It loads two PDF files from the server's file system: cover_template.pdf and main_report.pdf.
Using pdf-lib, it loads the cover page template into memory.
It draws the user's text (name, register number) onto the first page of the cover page template at specific X/Y coordinates.
It creates a new, blank PDF document in memory.
It copies the modified cover page into the new document.
It then copies all pages from the main_report.pdf into the new document.
It saves the final merged document as a byte array (Uint8Array).
API Response: The server sends the byte array back to the client with the appropriate headers (Content-Type: application/pdf and Content-Disposition: attachment).
Client (Browser): The browser receives this response and, due to the headers, automatically triggers a download of the final PDF file.
3. Development Plan: Sprints & Milestones
This project can be broken down into four manageable sprints.
Sprint 0: Project Setup & Asset Preparation
Tasks:
Initialize a new Next.js project: npx create-next-app@latest carmel-pdf-generator.
Install necessary dependencies: npm install pdf-lib.
Set up the project structure: Create a public directory to store the static PDF files.
Asset Preparation:
Create the cover_template.pdf: This is just the first page of your report, saved as a single-page PDF, with blank spaces where the user data will go.
Create the main_report.pdf: This is the rest of your technical document (from page 2 onwards).
Place both cover_template.pdf and main_report.pdf in the /public directory.
Sprint 1: Frontend Development (The User Form)
Goal: Build the user-facing interface.
Tasks:
Design the main page (pages/index.js).
Create a React component for the input form (components/ReportForm.js).
The form should include input fields for "Submitted By," "Register Number," and "Group Members" (a textarea might be good for this).
Use React's useState hook to manage the form's state.
Add a "Generate & Download PDF" button, which will be disabled until the form is filled.
Style the page and form using Tailwind CSS for a clean, professional look.
Sprint 2: Backend Development (The PDF Engine)
Goal: Create the API endpoint that does the heavy lifting.
Tasks:
Create the API route file: pages/api/generate-pdf.js.
In this file, import pdf-lib and Node.js fs/promises to read files.
Write the handler function that will:
Read the user data from the req.body.
Load cover_template.pdf and main_report.pdf from the file system.
Use pdf-lib's PDFDocument.load() to process both files.
Get the first page of the cover template document.
Use the page.drawText() method to write the user's details onto the cover page. Note: This requires trial and error to find the perfect X/Y coordinates for the text placement. You may also need to embed a standard font like StandardFonts.TimesRoman.
Create a new PDFDocument.
Copy the modified cover page and all pages from the main report into this new document.
Serialize the final PDF to a Uint8Array using pdfDoc.save().
Set the response headers correctly and send the PDF bytes back to the client.
Sprint 3: Integration & Finalization
Goal: Connect the frontend form to the backend API and trigger the download.
Tasks:
In your ReportForm.js component, create an async function to handle the form submission.
On submit, use the fetch() API to make a POST request to /api/generate-pdf.
Stringify the form state and include it as the request body.
Handle the response from the API. The response will be the raw PDF data.
Convert the response to a Blob.
Use URL.createObjectURL() to create a temporary URL for the blob.
Create a temporary <a> element in the DOM, set its href to the object URL, set the download attribute (e.g., download="Asynchronous_Counter_Report.pdf"), and programmatically click it to trigger the download.
Add loading states and error handling (e.g., show a spinner while the PDF is generating).
4. Testing & Deployment
Testing Phase:
Functionality Testing: Does the form submit correctly? Does the download trigger?
Validation: Open the downloaded PDF. Are all the user details present? Are they in the correct positions? Is the formatting correct?
Cross-Browser Testing: Test the application in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari to ensure consistent behavior.
Error Handling: What happens if the API fails? The user should see a friendly error message.
Deployment Phase:
Push your project code to a GitHub repository.
Create an account on Vercel.
Connect your GitHub account to Vercel and import the project repository.
Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project and deploy it.
Your application will be live on a public URL.
5. Challenges & Considerations
Text Positioning: Finding the exact coordinates for drawText will require some iteration.
Font Embedding: For custom fonts, you would need to load a .ttf or .otf file and embed it, which adds complexity. Sticking to standard fonts is easiest to start.
Performance: For very large PDFs, the generation process might take a few seconds. A loading indicator is crucial for a good user experience.
